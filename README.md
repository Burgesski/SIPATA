# SIPATA

Sediment Input Point And Transport Analysis (SIPATA) is code used to model and analyse a multi-lithology source-to-sink sediment transport sysetm. SIPTA uses a simple model of sediment distribution and a two different obejctive function error calculations combined wiht a Monte Carlo paramter space search to generate a best fit with specified lithology distribution data. Full details are provided in Burgess et al. (in reivew) Journal Geological Society of London. 
SIPATA. SIPATA_singleSource.m will generate the model pplots used in Burgess et al Figure 4, and SIPATA_multipleSources.m will generate the diagrams used in Burgess et al Figures 5 & 6. 
The data collection method and significance of the data in the .csv files is also fully explained in Burgess et al (in reivew).

Collaboration on further development of this code is welcome.
